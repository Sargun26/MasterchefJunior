Kheer, payasa, payasam or phirni is a type of pudding from the Indian subcontinent, made by boiling milk, sugar, and rice, although rice may be substitute with one of the following: bulgar wheat, millet, tapioca, vermicelli, or sweet corn.Kheer is a decadent, mellow rice pudding that has many layers of subtle flavour.


 The rich, creamy taste of sweetened milk is enhanced by the fragrance of cardamom and saffron. What's even more amazing is how different kheer tastes depending on whether you serve it hot or chilled.


It is a very simple dish to cook where we require boiled milk and presoaked rice.
